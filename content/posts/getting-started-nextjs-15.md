# Introduction

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React framework. This release focuses on performance, developer experience, and powerful new capabilities.

## Key Features

### Turbopack

Turbopack is the next-generation bundler that offers significantly faster build times compared to Webpack. It's built with Rust and optimized for modern JavaScript applications.

- **Up to 700x faster** than Webpack for large applications
- **Incremental compilation** for lightning-fast hot module replacement
- **Native TypeScript support** without additional configuration

### Server Components

Enhanced performance with React Server Components that allow you to build applications with better performance and smaller bundle sizes.

```typescript
// Server Component example
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const posts = await data.json()

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### App Router

The improved routing architecture provides:

- **Nested layouts** for better UI composition
- **Loading and error states** out of the box
- **Streaming** for progressive rendering
- **Parallel routes** for advanced patterns

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of creating a new Next.js 15 page:

```typescript
export default function Page() {
  return <div>Hello Next.js 15!</div>
}
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 15 project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Performance Improvements

Next.js 15 includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Improved image optimization** with automatic format detection
2. **Better caching strategies** for static and dynamic content
3. **Optimized font loading** with automatic subsetting

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is a significant upgrade that improves developer experience and application performance. Whether you're building a small blog or a large-scale application, Next.js 15 provides the tools and optimizations you need to succeed.
